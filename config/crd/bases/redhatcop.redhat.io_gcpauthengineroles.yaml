                        message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.

                        observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
                        For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
                        with respect to the current state of the instance.

                        reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
                        Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
                        and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
                        The value should be a CamelCase string.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
